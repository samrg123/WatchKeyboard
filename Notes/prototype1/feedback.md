Nicole:
    - The buttons are really small, hard to hit
    - Layout is good, would benifit from predictive text (autocorrect - Changes word automatically)
    - Are the character keys needed? Why not just have a dedicated button to switch characters to symbols (keep period and space bar)
    - Didn't recognize space symbol. Recommended "SP" for space instead
    - Make space key bigger

Yipeng's Users:
    - buttons are too small for fingers
    - easy to hit wrong button
    - the round type of buttons are not intuitive according to users who are already familiar with the qwerty keyboard
    - it takes time for users to find the right button to type
    - better to have a nine button layout
