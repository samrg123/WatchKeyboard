    TODO:
  
        - draw a more detailed picture of the dial
  
  - Discuss 'testing' process
    
    - Talked to each other to come up with a list of pros/cons with the prototype
    - Draw the dial to scale and realize how small the buttons are.
    - Ask 3rd party for their input/thoughts on to-scale drawing  
  
  - refinement
    
    - we needed bigger buttons, so we made bigger buttons in the next prototype

dial feedback
