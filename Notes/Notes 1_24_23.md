TODO:
    setup Git repo
    XXX - setup regular zoom meetings

    Deliverables:
        - Brainstorm ideas - sketches and proof
        - Get MVP/prototype 1 started in processing research how to create a UI

Brainstorms:
    Idea 1:
        - Use character recognition Like apple watch or samsung smart watch
        Pros:
            - Fast, Intuitive, easy to use
        Cons:
            - Hard to implement in short time window
            - If not implemented well (like on Samsung watch) typing can be slow and frustrating when not implemented correctly            

    Idea 2:
        - Use dials, each character occupies certain angles at the edge, users start touching at the center, and release at the edge to type
        Pros:
            - Easy implementation
        Cons:
            - Each character only occupies a small angle, it might be easy to go to the wrong character
            - Hard to backspace out a word
            - No predicted words

    Idea 3:
        - Dividing screen into 26 characters makes each character hard to see/press. Rather than that we divide screen into 6 segments each with ~4/5 characters inside. There is a deadzone/ball in the middle of the screen that when held down and slid to a segment a second dial that pops up to type character
        Pros:
            - Still relative easy to implement
            - Easier to type than single dial  
        Cons:
            - Adds extra redirection to type letter
            - Potentially slower than Idea 2
            - Hard to backspace out a word
            - No predicted words

    Idea 3.5:
        - Have space, backspace and other functional buttons at the main screen, still have to start typing at the center of the screen. The functional buttons functions when tapped and released. Character typing functions when tapped at the center, dragged to the edges and to the other ends.a
        Add-on Pros:
            - utilize the wasted space at the main screen for suggested words
            - enable faster deletion and space
Tasks:
    - Sam:
        - Look into getting touch/gesture input
    
    - Tyson:
        - Look into graphics
    
    - Lauren:
        - Look into spell check APIs and/or word recommendations
