    -Loren:
        - Typed word needs to be lowercase
        - Even though it is laid out as a qwerty, users need to get familiar with the location of the characters in the main menu to type faster
        - Maybe layout the sub menus in a better way for memorization
        - Not super intuitive if not told how to type at first
    
    - Nicole:
        - Didn't know that the buttons only activated when circle is dragged to edge of screen, thought you had to hold them down
        - Decrease the deadzone
        - Needs cursor
        - Text needs to be brighter
        - Suggested ABC layout
        
    - Sam:
        - Hard to select ERT with finger over QWERT

    Solutions:
        - Add deadzone circle
        - Decrease deadzone radius
        - DONE: Add cursor
        - DONE: Change opacity of buttons in proportion to deadzone distance
        - DONE: Add suggested word
        - DONE: Make text brighter
        - DONE: Maybe add back the backspace and space in the second layer for type consistency
        - Change to ABC layout (not completely sure)
        - Maybe use same face layout for each keyboard button (not completly sure)
        - Maybe show live changes to string as you hover over character in face
